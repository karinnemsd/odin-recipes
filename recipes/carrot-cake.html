        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p>Brazilian carrot cake is nicely moist and fluffy, smells like a sunny morning in spring, has a beautiful bright dough, and the chocolate glaze is a sweet finishing touch.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> 2 cups (300 grams) carrots, peeled </li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup (325 grams) sugar</li>
            <li>1 cup (250 milliliters) vegetable oil</li>
            <li>2 cups (256 grams) all-purpose flour, sifted</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
            <li>A pinch of salt</li>            
        </ul>
        <h3>Chocolate Sauce</h3>
        <p>You can use a brigadeiro glaze to cover your cake! For that, use half of the quantities of the <a href="brigadeiro.html>">brigadeiro recipe</a>.</p>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven at 350°F/180°C.</li>
            <li>Butter the springform pan and dust flour through it.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, add the baking powder to the flour and mix the ingredients delicately. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Add the eggs, oil, salt, sugar, and peeled carrots cut in chunks to the blender and blend until it’s homogeneous.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture into the large bowl with flour and mix gently until all flour has incorporated.</li>
            <li>Pour the batter into the springform pan and bake it for approximately 50 minutes.</li>
            <li>Once you’re done, remove the cake from the oven and let it cool down for 10-15 minutes before removing the springform pan.</li>            
            <li>Follow the <a href="brigadeiro.html"> brigadeiro recipe</a> for making the chocolate glaze (you don't need to roll them, stop before this step).</li>
            <li>Remove the springform pan and pour the chocolate sauce onto the cake.</li>
            <li>Serve it with a cup of coffee and enjoy!</li>
