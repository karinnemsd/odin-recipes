        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 cup dulce de leche</li>
            <li>75 ml whipping cream</li>

        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the dessert cups where you will be assembling the mousse. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whip the cream until soft peaks form and put it in the fridge.</li>
            <li>In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk the egg whites until foam increases in volume at medium-high speed.</li>
            <li>When the egg whites have increased approximately four times in volume, slowly add the brown sugar at the side of the bowl.</li>
            <li>Increase speed to high and continue to whisk until stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Stir in 1/3 of the whipped cream with a spatula to the dulce de leche and mix until they have fully integrated. Fold in the remaining 2/3 of the cream very gently.</li>
            <li>Add 1/3 of the egg whites to the dulce de leche mixture. Gently mix until they have incorporated. Fold in the remaining 2/3 of the egg whites.</li>
            <li>Divide the mousse between bowls and chill for at least 4 hours.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle some cocoa powder over the mousse and serve it cold.</li>
