        <h2>Description:</h2>
        <p class="desc">Brigadeiro is a Brazilian chocolate truffle garnished with sprinkles.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 can (397 grams) sweetned condensed milk</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons unsweeted cocoa powder</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon butter</li>
            <li>Chocolate sprinkles</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Instructions:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Grease a plate with butter and set aside.</li>
            <li>In a medium non-stick pan, combine the condensed milk, butter, and cocoa powder in medium heat and mix it well.</li>
            <li>The mixture thickens after about 10-12 minutes, and once you can run your silicone spatula through the middle of it without it running back together for 2-3 seconds, it is done.</li>
            <li>Pour the mixture onto the lightly greased plate and let it chill in the fridge for an hour.</li>
            <li>In the meantime, prepare the candy cups and place the sprinkles in a bowl.</li>
            <li>Once chilled, you are ready to roll the little balls. Lightly wet your hands, put a tablespoon of the chewy mixture on your hands, and roll into a small ball.</li>
            <li>Roll it over the sprinkles.</li>
            <li>Place the balls in the candy cups, and voila! Enjoy it!</li>
        </ol>
